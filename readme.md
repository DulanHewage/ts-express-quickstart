# TypeScript Express REST API Starter Template

This project is a starter template for building a REST API using Express and TypeScript. It provides a basic structure and configuration to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- Express server setup with TypeScript
- Routing and middleware configuration
- Error handling and logging
- Environment variables configuration
- Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development
- ESLint for enforcing coding style and finding problems
- Prettier for code formatting
- Database integration (optional)

## Getting Started

To use this starter template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DulanHewage/ts-express-quickstart.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the configuration values as needed.
4. Start the server: `npm start`

You can now access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.
